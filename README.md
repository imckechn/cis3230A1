### Fall 2022

A basic ruby program where we are just writing classes for a game, not supposed to have a program calling them, just a helper class that tests everything.

### Intent of Program
It's a game where a player can put either (or both) dice and a coin into a hand, cup, or bag, and then role/flip them and get random results back. It's supposed to emulate really life.
